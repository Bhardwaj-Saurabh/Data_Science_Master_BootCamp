What is an ensemble technique in machine learning?**\n","\n","**Answer:**\n","\n","In machine learning, ensemble techniques refer to the methods of combining multiple models to improve the accuracy of predictions. The idea is to build multiple models that are different from each other in some way, and then combine their predictions to get a more accurate result than any individual model. \n","\n","The main advantages of ensemble techniques are:\n","\n","**Increased accuracy:** Ensemble techniques can significantly increase the accuracy of predictions compared to a single model.

Why are ensemble techniques used in machine learning?**\n","\n","**Answer:**\n","\n","There are two main types of ensemble techniques in machine learning:\n","\n","**Bagging:** Bagging stands for Bootstrap Aggregating.

Are ensemble techniques always better than individual models?**\n","\n","**Answer:**\n","\n","Ensemble techniques are not always better than individual models, as it depends on the specific problem and data being used.
