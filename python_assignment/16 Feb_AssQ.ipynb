What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.:**\n","\n","A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.\n","\n","SQL, which stands for “Structured Query Language,” is the programming language that’s been widely used in managing data in relational database management systems (RDBMS) since the 1970s. In the early years, when storage was expensive, SQL databases focused on reducing data duplication.\n","\n","NoSQL is a non-relational database, meaning it allows different structures than a SQL database and more flexibility to use a format that best fits the data. The term “NoSQL” was not coined until the early 2000s. It doesn’t mean the systems don’t use SQL, as NoSQL databases do sometimes support some SQL commands. More accurately, “NoSQL” is sometimes defined as “not only SQL.”\n"],"metadata":{"id":"JH04JDHqmc4s"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.**\n","\n","A data definition language (DDL) is a computer language used to create and modify the structure of database objects in a database. These database objects include views, schemas, tables, indexes, etc.\n","\n","CREATE:\n","\n","This command builds a new table and has a predefined syntax. The CREATE statement syntax is:\n","\n","CREATE TABLE [table name] ([column definitions]) [table parameters];\n","\n","For example:\n","\n","CREATE TABLE Employee (Employee Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, First name CHAR (50) NULL, Last name CHAR (75) NOT NULL);\n","\n","DROP:\n","\n","A drop command is used to delete objects such as a table, index or view. A DROP statement cannot be rolled back, so once an object is destroyed, there’s no way to recover it.\n","\n","Drop statement syntax is:\n","\n","DROP object type object name;\n","\n","For example:\n","\n","DROP TABLE Employee;\n","\n","Alter: \n","\n","An alter command modifies an existing database table. This command can add up additional column, drop existing columns and even change the data type of columns involved in a database table.\n","\n","An alter command syntax is:\n","\n","ALTER object type object name parameters;\n","\n","For example:\n","\n","ALTER TABLE Employee ADD PRIMARY KEY (employee_pk);\n","\n","\n","Truncate:\n","\n","Similar to DROP, the TRUNCATE statement is used to quickly remove all records from a table. However, unlike DROP that completely destroys a table, TRUNCATE preserves its full structure to be reused later.\n","\n","Truncate statement syntax is:\n","\n","TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;\n","\n","For example:\n","\n","TRUNCATE TABLE Employee;"],"metadata":{"id":"FHzuI38Emc2U"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example.**\n","\n","DML resembles simple English language and enhances efficient user interaction with the system. The functional capability of DML is organized in manipulation commands like SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT INTO and DELETE FROM, as described below:\n","\n","UPDATE: This command modifies data of one or more records. An update command syntax is UPDATE [table name] SET [column name = value] where [condition].\n","\n","INSERT: This command adds one or more records to a database table. The insert command syntax is INSERT INTO [table name] [column(s)] VALUES [value(s)].\n","\n","DELETE: This command removes one or more records from a table according to specified conditions. Delete command syntax is DELETE FROM [table name] where [condition]."],"metadata":{"id":"lF8-6IxLmcz1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Q4. What is DQL?

Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.**\n","\n","A primary key is used to ensure that data in the specific column is unique. A column cannot have NULL values. It is either an existing table column or a column that is specifically generated by the database according to a defined sequence. \n","\n","A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables. It is a column (or columns) that references a column (most often the primary key) of another table. "],"metadata":{"id":"kAGtaDe7mcu0"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Q6.

Give the order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query.**\n","\n","The order in which the clauses in queries are executed is as follows:\n","\n","1.

WHERE: The WHERE clause is executed to filter out records that do not meet the constraints.\n","\n","3.
