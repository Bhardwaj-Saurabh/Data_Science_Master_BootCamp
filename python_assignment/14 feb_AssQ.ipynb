What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.**\n","\n","Multithreading (sometimes simply \"threading\") is when a program creates multiple threads with execution cycling among them, so one longer-running task doesn't block all the others. This works well for tasks that can be broken down into smaller subtasks, which can then each be given to a thread to be completed.\n","\n","In Python, the threading module provides a very simple and intuitive API for spawning multiple threads in a program. Let us consider a simple example using a threading module: \n","\n","**The Threading Module**\n","\n","threading.currentThread() − Returns the number of thread objects in the caller's thread control. threading.enumerate() − Returns a list of all thread objects that are currently active.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"dSOlTU5m22jP"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Q2.
